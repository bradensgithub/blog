      <p>Do you have a worn-out, poorly-fitting overcoat that you don’t wear anymore? Or maybe you’re thinking of thrifting a wool coat? By mid-November of 2015, old ladies in the streets of St. Petersburg, Russia started yelling at me to “Get a real coat!” That was my cue that a harsh Russian winter was coming fast. It was time for me to buy an overcoat. Functionality was especially important for this coat because I knew I’d be spending many hours each day outside in the northern winter but, since I was also wearing a suit daily, I wanted it to be a somewhat traditionally styled dress coat.</p>

      <p>While we probably won’t ever go back to the point where a large percentage of white-collar men wore suits every day, I believe that formality is cyclical (for the most part). Although not as widespread as in the past, the traditional tuxedo won’t be phased out any time soon. What does change is the perception around it and its relationship with a traditional suit..
